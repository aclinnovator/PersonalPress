            The words are hurled around like epithets.People who reject the findings of climate science are dismissed as deniers and disinformers. Those who accept the science are attacked as alarmists or warmistas.  The latter term, evoking the Sandinista revolutionaries of Nicaragua, is perhaps meant to suggest that the science is part of some socialist plot.In the long-running political battles overclimate change, the fight about what to call the various factions has been going on for a long time. Recently, though, the issue has taken a new turn, with a public appeal that has garnered 22,000 signatures and counting.Thepetitionasks the news media to abandon the most frequently used term for people who question climate science, skeptic, and call them climate deniers instead.Climate scientists are among the most vocal critics of using the term climate skeptic to describe people who flatly reject their findings. They point out that skepticism is the very foundation of the scientific method. The modern consensus about the risks of climate change, they say, is based on evidence that has piled up over the course of decades and has been subjected to critical scrutiny every step of the way.Drop into any climate science convention, in fact, and you will hear vigorous debate about the details of the latest studies. While they may disagree over the fine points, those same researchers are virtually unanimous in warning that society is runningextraordinary risksby continuing to pump huge quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.In other words, the climate scientists see themselves as the true skeptics, having arrived at a durable consensus about emissions simply because the evidence of risk has become overwhelming. And in this view, people who reject the evidence are phony skeptics, arguing their case by cherry-picking studies, manipulating data, and refusing to weigh the evidence as a whole.The petition asking the media to drop the climate skeptic label began withMark B. Boslough, a physicist in New Mexico who grew increasingly annoyed by the term over several years. The phrase is wrong, he said, because these people do not embrace the scientific method.Dr. Boslough is active in a group called theCommittee for Skeptical Inquiry, which has long battled pseudoscience in all its forms. Late last year, he wrote apublic letteron the issue, and dozens of scientists and science advocates associated with the committee quickly signed it. They include Bill Nye, of Science Guy" fame, and Lawrence M. Krauss, the physicist and best-selling author.A climate advocacy organization,Forecast the Facts, picked up on the letter and turned it into a petition. Once the signatures reach 25,000, the group intends to present a formal request to major news organizations to alter their terminology.All of which raises an obvious question: If not skeptic, what should the opponents of climate science be called?As a first step, it helps to understand why they so vigorously denounce the science. The opposition is coming from a certain faction of the political right. Many of these conservatives understand that since greenhouse emissions are caused by virtually every economic activity of modern society, they are likely to be reduced only by extensive government intervention in the market.So casting doubt on the science is a way to ward off such regulation. This movement is mainly rooted in ideology, but much of the money to disseminate its writings comes from companies that profit from fossil fuels.Despite their shared goal of opposing regulation, however, these opponents of climate science are not all of one mind in other respects, and thus no single term really fits them all.Some make scientifically ludicrous claims, such as denying that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas or rejecting the idea that humans are responsible for its increase in the atmosphere. Others deny that Earth is actually warming, despite overwhelming evidence that it is, including the rapid melting of billions of tons of land ice all over the planet.Yet the critics of established climate science also include a handful of people with credentials in atmospheric physics, and track records of publishing in the field. They acknowledge the heat-trapping powers of greenhouse gases, and they distance themselves from people who deny such basic points.For Gods sake, I cant be lumped in with that crowd, said Patrick J. Michaels, a former University of Virginia scientist employed by the libertarianCato Institutein Washington.Contrarian scientists like Dr. Michaels tend to argue that the warming will be limited, or will occur so gradually that people will cope with it successfully, or that technology will come along to save the day  or all of the above.The contrarian scientists like to present these upbeat scenarios as the only plausible outcomes from runaway emissions growth. Mainstream scientists see them as being the low end of a range of possible outcomes that includes an alarming high end, and they say the only way to reduce the risks is to reduce emissions.The dissenting scientists have been called lukewarmers by some, for their view that Earth will warm only a little. That is a term Dr. Michaels embraces. I think its wonderful! he said. He is working on a book, The Lukewarmers Manifesto.When they publish in scientific journals, presenting data and arguments to support their views, these contrarians are practicing science, and perhaps the skeptic label is applicable. But not all of them are eager to embrace it.As far as I can tell, skepticism involves doubts about a plausible proposition, another of these scientists, Richard S. Lindzen, told an audience a few years ago. I think current global warming alarm does not represent a plausible proposition.Papers by Dr. Lindzen and others disputing the risks of global warming have fared poorly in the scientific literature, with mainstream scientists pointing out what they see as fatal errors. Nonetheless, these contrarian scientists testify before Congress and make statements inconsistent with the vast bulk of the scientific evidence, claiming near certainty that society is not running any risk worth worrying about.It is perhaps no surprise that many environmentalists have started to call them deniers.The scientific dissenters object to that word, claiming it is a deliberate attempt to link them to Holocaust denial. Some academics sharply dispute having any such intention, but others have started using the slightly softer word denialist to make the same point without stirring complaints about evoking the Holocaust.Scientific denialism has crept into other aspects of modern life, of course, manifesting itself as creationism, anti-vaccine ideology and the opposition togenetically modified crops, among other doctrines.To groups holding such views, evidence just doesnt matter any more, said Riley E. Dunlap, a sociologist at Oklahoma State University. It becomes possible to create an alternate reality.But Dr. Dunlap pointed out that the stakes with most of these issues are not as high as with climate-change denial, for the simple reason that the fate of the planet may hang in the balance.

            SAN FRANCISCO   The U.S. National Security Agency has figured out how to hide spying software deep within hard drives made by Western Digital, Seagate, Toshiba and other top manufacturers, giving the agency the means to eavesdrop on the majority of the world's computers, according to cyber researchers and former operatives.That long-sought and closely guarded ability was part of a cluster of spying programs discovered by Kaspersky Lab, the Moscow-based security software maker that has exposed a series of Western cyberespionage operations.Kaspersky said it found personal computers in 30 countries infected with one or more of the spying programs, with the most infections seen in Iran, followed by Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Mali, Syria, Yemen and Algeria. The targets  included government and military institutions, telecommunication companies, banks, energy companies, nuclear researchers, media, and Islamic activists, Kaspersky said. (http://reut.rs/1L5knm0)The firm declined to publicly name the country behind the spying campaign, but said it was closely linked to Stuxnet, the NSA-led cyberweapon that was used to attack Iran's uranium enrichment facility. The NSA is the agency responsible for gathering electronic intelligence on behalf of the United States.A former NSA employee told Reuters that Kaspersky's analysis was correct, and that people still in the intelligence agency valued these spying programs as highly as Stuxnet. Another former intelligence operative confirmed that the NSA had developed the prized technique of concealing spyware in hard drives, but said he did not know which spy efforts relied on it.NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines declined to comment.Kaspersky published the technical details of its research on Monday, which should help infected institutions detect the spying programs, some of which trace back as far as 2001. (http://bit.ly/17bPUUe)The disclosure could further hurt the NSA's surveillance abilities, already damaged by massive leaks by former contractor Edward Snowden. Snowden's revelations have hurt the United States' relations with some allies and slowed the sales of U.S. technology products abroad.The exposure of these new spying tools could lead to greater backlash against Western technology, particularly in countries such as China, which is already drafting regulations that would require most bank technology suppliers to proffer copies of their software code for inspection.TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHAccording to Kaspersky, the spies made a technological breakthrough by figuring out how to lodge malicious software in the obscure code called firmware that launches every time a computer is turned on.Disk drive firmware is viewed by spies and cybersecurity experts as the second-most valuable real estate on a PC for a hacker, second only to the BIOS code invoked automatically as a computer boots up."The hardware will be able to infect the computer over and over," lead Kaspersky researcher Costin Raiu said in an interview.Though the leaders of the still-active espionage campaign could have taken control of thousands of PCs, giving them the ability to steal files or eavesdrop on anything they wanted, the spies were selective and only established full remote control over machines belonging to the most desirable foreign targets, according to Raiu. He said Kaspersky found only a few especially high-value computers with the hard-drive infections.Kaspersky's reconstructions of the spying programs show that they could work in disk drives sold by more than a dozen companies, comprising essentially the entire market. They include Western Digital Corp, Seagate Technology Plc, Toshiba Corp, IBM, Micron Technology Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.Western Digital, Seagate and Micron said they had no knowledge of these spying programs. Toshiba and Samsung declined to comment. IBM did not respond to requests for comment.GETTING THE SOURCE CODERaiu said the authors of the spying programs must have had access to the proprietary source code that directs the actions of the hard drives. That code can serve as a roadmap to vulnerabilities, allowing those who study it to launch attacks much more easily."There is zero chance that someone could rewrite the [hard drive] operating system using public information," Raiu said.Concerns about access to source code flared after a series of high-profile cyberattacks on Google Inc and other U.S. companies in 2009 that were blamed on China. Investigators have said they found evidence that the hackers gained access to source code from several big U.S. tech and defense companies.It is not clear how the NSA may have obtained the hard drives' source code. Western Digital spokesman Steve Shattuck said the company "has not provided its source code to government agencies." The other hard drive makers would not say if they had shared their source code with the NSA.Seagate spokesman Clive Over said it has "secure measures to prevent tampering or reverse engineering of its firmware and other technologies." Micron spokesman Daniel Francisco said the company took the security of its products seriously and "we are not aware of any instances of foreign code."According to former intelligence operatives, the NSA has multiple ways of obtaining source code from tech companies, including asking directly and posing as a software developer. If a company wants to sell products to the Pentagon or another sensitive U.S. agency, the government can request a security audit to make sure the source code is safe."They don't admit it, but they do say, 'We're going to do an evaluation, we need the source code,'" said Vincent Liu, a partner at security consulting firm Bishop Fox and former NSA analyst. "It's usually the NSA doing the evaluation, and it's a pretty small leap to say they're going to keep that source code."Kaspersky called the authors of the spying program "the Equation group," named after their embrace of complex encryption formulas.The group used a variety of means to spread other spying programs, such as by compromising jihadist websites, infecting USB sticks and CDs, and developing a self-spreading computer worm called Fanny, Kasperky said.Fanny was like Stuxnet in that it exploited two of the same undisclosed software flaws, known as "zero days," which strongly suggested collaboration by the authors, Raiu said. He added that it was "quite possible" that the Equation group used Fanny to scout out targets for Stuxnet in Iran and spread the virus.(Reporting by Joseph Menn; Editing by Tiffany Wu)

            The safety net helped keep Camille Saunders from falling, but not Charles Constance.The difference? Ms. Saunders has a job, and Mr. Constance does not. And therein lies a tale of a profound shift in government support for low-income Americans at a time when stagnating wages and unstable schedules have kept many workers living near or below the poverty line.Assistance to needy Americans has grown at a gallop since the mid-1980s, giving a hand up to the disabled, the working poor and married couples with children. At the same time, though, government aid directed at the nations poorest individuals has shrunk.Most observers would think that the government should support those who have the lowest incomes the most, and provide less help to those with higher incomes,Robert A. Moffitt, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, writes in a forthcoming article in the journal Demography. But that is not the case.Mr. Moffitt found that government assistance for families whose incomes flutter just above the poverty line nearly doubled from 1983 to 2004 after taking inflation into account. The numbers look very different for those scraping along at the bottom, generally unemployed single mothers with children. Their benefits declined in real terms by about one-third.During the Great Recession, assistance to the poorest briefly expanded but has since fallen back, he said, and there is no indication that the long-run trend is shifting.Theres been this emphasis on rewarding workers and people like the elderly or disabled who are considered the deserving poor, saidMr. Moffitt, referring to a revival in recent decades of age-old attitudes toward those at the bottom of the economic ladder. If youre not working, the interpretation is that youre not trying.President Obamasnew proposalsfor a $500 tax credit for working parents with children, an increase in the minimum wage and paid parental leave are just the latest examples of this trend.The shift reflects not only a more conservative political climate but also a response to broader economic forces, like globalization, advancing technology and workers enfeebled bargaining power, all of which have had a role in eliminating millions of traditional middle-class jobs and holding down wages.More than 300,000 California workers at big companies like Walmart, for example, qualify for Medi-Cal, the states health insurance for the poor,according to a studyfrom the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California, Berkeley. And in New York, 40 percent ofbank tellersare on some form of public aid like food stamps.Across the country, working families account for nearly three-quarters of the people enrolled in major public benefits programs and 63 percent of the costs, the Berkeley researchers concluded.Experts emphasize that they do not want to pit one needy group against another. The working poor deserve some help; theres no way I want to cut any of that, Mr. Moffitt of Johns Hopkins said. But theres a group here thats being left out.Distinguishing betweenpeople who deserve public generosity and those who dont dates to colonial times, but the idea has found powerful champions on both sides of the political divide, including Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the influential new Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.The move away from giving more aid to those in abject poverty can be traced, in part, to the campaign to end welfare as we know it, promoted by President Bill Clinton during his 1992 presidential run andaccomplishedin 1996 when the system was overhauled.The program he created,Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, imposes time limits and work rules on recipients. And when a states allotted budget runs out, poor families are turned away.It got rid of welfare cheaters, Sheldon Danziger, president of the Russell Sage Foundation, said of the Clinton-era changes. But we forgot about people who want to work but cant find anybody to hire them.Like Mr. Constance. I couldnt really find any kind of work or the help that I needed to help raise my son, said Mr. Constance, 53, who until recently had been living at a homeless shelter in New Orleans with his 9-year old son, Pablo.A prison record from the 1980s, the result of selling two ounces of marijuana in Texas, has hampered his search for work as a house painter. Thats why I say its been a hard road for me trying to raise my son, with all those ghosts and shadows over my head, he said.As he discovered, benefits vary greatly from one state to the next. He applied to the Temporary Assistance program in Miami, he said, but was uncertain about why he never received any. It wasnt nothing but problem after problem after problem, he said.Last year, he moved with his son to New Orleans, where he said he was offered $123 a month in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families aid in exchange for community service. He tried it, but the time and money spent commuting wasnt worth it, he said, explaining that he was better off using the time to look for an odd job, a car to wash or a yard to rake.He said he received $318 a month in food stamps, and that his son received $390 a month from disability payments through his mother, who still lives in Florida.After months of bouncing around in emergency homeless shelters, the two are now settled in an apartment. The $700 monthly rent is being paid by the Salvation Army for six months, while Mr. Constance searches for a permanent job. With the light bill and water bill, I dont have enough to take care of all of that, he said.LaDonna Pavetti, the vice president for family income support policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research organization in the nations capital, said that without the small cash allotments previously available, it becomes much trickier to figure out how to make ends meet.For Ms. Saunders, a 34-year-old security guard with two young daughters in Washington, government assistance has come in the form of food stamps, a rent subsidy, a tax refund for low-wage earners and a matching grant for budding entrepreneurs.That aid has helped put food on the table after Ms. Saunderss weekly $459 paycheck runs out and has given her hope that she might be able to start her own cleaning business.Im very much a go-getter, Ms. Saunders said. For a person that doesnt make much money, its definitely a big help.She supplements her income as a security guard with $297 a month in food stamps and depends onMedicaidfor health insurance. The earned-income tax credit, considered by many advocates to be the best program to help nudge people above the poverty line, brought the family $5,500 in federal and local tax refunds.One of the lucky few to live in federally subsidized housing, Ms. Saunders pays only $110 a month for her two-bedroom apartment in the northeast section of Washington. Its not the best neighborhood, she said, but its cheap.And by saving $1,000 to put toward her dream of a cleaning service, she is now designated to receive a $4,000 tax-free, no-strings-attached federal subsidy through the Individual Development Accounts program. These accounts, which are financed through public money and private donations, can be used only to help buy a home, pay for college or start a business.This is not a handout approach, said Joseph Leitmann-Santa Cruz, the head of Capital Area Asset Builders, the nonprofit organization that administers development accounts in the region. Earlier this year he insisted on rescheduling a meeting with Ms. Saunders so she could get some sleep after working an 18-hour double shift. Its a way for society to co-invest with a poor working family, he said.Ms. Saunders also has the advantage of living in the District of Columbia, which offers more generous benefits for low-income families than many states. Mr. Constance in New Orleans knows the difference.Not getting any kind of help or anything, he said, its been very rough.

            LONDON   Online gambling company 888 Holdings said discussions concerning a 720 million pound takeover by Britain's biggest bookmaker William Hill had ended after talks broke down over price with a key stakeholder.Shares in 888, which previously in 2011 saw a planned takeover by Britain's Ladbrokes collapse over pricing, fell 15 percent to 145 pence in early trading on Monday. William Hill shares were up 1.6 percent at 388p.888, whose shares had jumped more than 20 percent last week after talks between the two companies were confirmed, said on Monday it had discussed a possible recommended offer from William Hill valued at 200p plus a 3p dividend per share."Due to a significant difference of opinion on value with a key stakeholder, it has not been possible to reach agreement on the terms of a possible offer and the board of the company has agreed with William Hill to terminate discussions," 888 said.Two trusts set up by the Shaked family, one of 888's Israeli founders, each hold 24.34 percent stakes in the firm, with one thought to have wanted 300p a share, according to a report in the Times newspaper last week.888, which also said it had continued to trade in line with expectations, declined to comment beyond its statement. William Hill was not available for comment.Analysts had said 888's strong in-house technology was attractive to William Hill, which uses a number of third-party suppliers. Cost savings and improved exposure to international markets, particularly the United States, were also seen as benefits.More broadly, with tax and regulation increasing across the gambling sector's biggest markets, companies have begun to seek faster growth and more customers through online operations.In November online gambling company Bwin.Party said it was considering a range of proposals from interested parties. It has appointed Deutsche Bank to handle talks.(Editing by Kate Holton and David Holmes)

            Stung by family members urging him to be more affectionate, Irving Singer, a philosophy professor, spent years researching and writing a 1,300-page, three-volume examination of the subject titled The Nature of Love.This, like so many philosophical works, began as an attempt to understand my own inadequacies, he told The New York Times in 1987. Everyone in my family persuaded me that I ought to be more loving, which troubled me. So like most philosophers, I dealt with the criticism by constructing a theory and a philosophy which enabled me to dismiss their ideas.For 65 years, as a prolific writer and teacher, nearly 55 of them at theMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Professor Singer, who died on Feb. 1 at 89, mined the works of Marcel Proust, George Santayana, John Stuart Mill, John Dewey and others, unearthing, as he once wrote, imaginative and possibly genuine insights into the nature of human experience.He did the same sort of literary and philosophical spade work in producing his love trilogy  a majestic study, as Anatole Broyard wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1986.The next year, the writer and psychotherapist Michael Vincent Miller, reviewing the trilogys third volume, described Mr. Singer as a rare bird on the contemporary scene, a philosopher preoccupied with literature and steeped in Platonism, two traditions that have always treated love seriously.He not only readily confesses his own romanticism; he steadfastly refuses to give it up, Mr. Miller wrote in The Times. For he sees romantic love as a saving remnant, a viable and realistic conception of what is humanly possible. After passing through some bleak modern stretches, he emerges still an optimist about romance, even in marriage. He regards love as an imaginative act, an almost spontaneous bestowing of value on another, but he wants to root it in the sexiness of biology. Neither idealist nor materialist, Mr. Singer puts himself forward as a pluralist of love.Professor Singer was the author of 21 books on topics as diverse as creativity, morality, aesthetics, literature, music and film. His last one, Modes of Creativity: Philosophical Perspectives, was published in 2011. He retired from M.I.T. as a professor emeritus two years later, but was working on yet another book, Creativity in the Brain.He was born in Brooklyn on Dec. 24, 1925, the son of Isadore and Nettie Stromer Singer, immigrants from Austria-Hungary who owned a grocery store in Coney Island.After graduating from Townsend Harris High School in Manhattan at 15, he enrolled in Brooklyn College, then served in the Army, which assigned him to write a book, History of the 210th Field Artillery Group, his first. He later collected his letters home to his brother in an unpublished anthology, which he called Memories of World War II.After the war, Professor Singer studied at Biarritz American University in France and completed his bachelors degree under the G.I. Bill at Harvard, where he graduated summa cum laude in 1948.The next year he married Josephine Fisk, who would become an opera singer and what he called a semi-collaborator on his books.I dont write in a library; in fact, I dont even write at a desk anymore, he explained. I write in bed, where I am comfortable, and dictate to my wife. She often disagrees with what I say, and well discuss it, and sometimes I incorporate her ideas.Professor Singers wife died last year. His death, in Brighton, Mass., was confirmed by his daughter, Emily Singer. He is also survived by two other daughters, Anne Seinfeld and Margaret Singer; a son, Ben; and four grandchildren.Professor Singer earned a doctorate at Harvard and joined the M.I.T. faculty full time in 1959 after teaching at Harvard, Cornell, the University of Michigan and Johns Hopkins. He was awarded a Fulbright research scholar grant, a Guggenheim fellowship and a Rockefeller Foundation grant.Constructing intellectual histories rather than highbrow versions of the Kama Sutra, Professor Singer never tired of exploring whether romantic love was a recent invention and placing it in philosophical context. In a preface to another trilogy, Meaning in Life, he wrote:I envision the good life in its totality as including the love of persons, things and ideals so intricately intermeshed that the meaning in one contributes to the meaningfulness of the other two. That eventuates in the state of happiness everyone desires.Describing himself as a reconstructed romantic, Professor Singer said, I dont believe in romantic love in that it has to be sweet and painless. The best one can expect, he said, is meaningfulness with moments of real happiness.

            To the Editor:In A Future Segregated by Science? (column, Feb. 2), Charles M. Blow hit the mark: The United States needs to attract and retain more talent and diversity in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) to keep America competitive.Thats why President Obama has called for an all-hands-on-deck effort that brings together parents, teachers, professional societies, foundations, industry and others committed to giving more students opportunities in STEM. Thats why the president has called for training 100,000 additional K-to-12 STEM teachers, and more than 200 organizations have stepped up to help.Thats why the president highlighted this issue at his recent College Opportunity Summit, where more than 100 college and university presidents and other higher education leaders made specific commitments to improve and expand STEM learning on their campuses.But as Mr. Blows column highlights, we must do more and we will.JOHN P. HOLDRENAssistant to the Presidentfor Science and TechnologyWashingtonTo the Editor:Charles M. Blow documents the persistent underrepresentation of women and minorities in science, technology, engineering and math and suggests that these disparities require that we address barriers faced at each stage of education and employment.Reasons that women and underrepresented minorities do not go beyond STEM in college include insufficient engagement; lack of role models, mentoring and peer support; and insufficient mathematics preparation to thrive in STEM fields.Womens colleges continue to provide an environment that addresses these challenges. For example, Bryn Mawr College has an impressive record of producing STEM majors: On average, 25 percent of undergraduates over all, 16 percent of African-American students and 26 percent of Latina students graduated with a STEM major between 2011 and 2014. We can do more.Since 2011 Bryn Mawr has led partnerships with other colleges to help students thrive in STEM.The future of science can belong to us all.KIMBERLY WRIGHT CASSIDYPresident, Bryn Mawr CollegeBryn Mawr, Pa.

            WASHINGTON Droneon, the government says.Just not through the night sky. Or close to an airport. Or out of the operator's sight. And probably not winging its way with a pizza or package, any time soon.Long-anticipated rules proposed Sunday will open an era in which small (under 55 pounds) commercial unmanned aircraft perform routine tasks  crop monitoring, aerial photography, inspections of bridges and cell towers, and much more. But not right away. Final rules are probably two to three years away.And when they are in place, they may include a separate category with fewer restrictions for very small drones, likely to be defined as less than 4.4 pounds.The Federal Aviation Administration released a variety of proposed requirements for commercial operators to meet, such as passing a knowledge test administered by the agency as well as a federal security check. The small drones could travel as fast as 100 mph, at altitudes of 500 feet or lower. Flights over people except those involved in the drone's operation would be prohibited."We have tried to be flexible in writing these rules," said FAA Administrator Michael Huerta. "We want to maintain today's outstanding level of aviation safety without placing an undue regulatory burden on an emerging industry."The agency is researching technology that he hopes will eventually enable small drones to fly safely beyond the sight of operators, Huerta said. He emphasized that introduction of commercial drones into the national airspace will be a staged process. The government is also looking ahead to how larger drones might be allowed to fly in airspace shared by manned aircraft, for example, he said.One of the key safety concerns is that without a human on board the ability to "see and avoid" other aircraft is limited. Another concern is that the link between the operator and a remote control aircraft can be broken, causing the drone to fly away until it loses power or collides with something.Cases of flyaway drones getting stuck in trees or hitting buildings are rampant. Last month, a drone that its operator lost control of flew over the White House fence and crashed on the lawn before Secret Service agents could block it.Even with the proposed safety restrictions, drones can transform urban infrastructure management, farming, public safety, coastal security, military training, search and rescue, disaster response and more, the White House said in a presidential memorandum on privacy released in conjunction with the rules.The memorandum lays out measures federal agencies must follow to guard against abuse of data collected in their drone flights. Among other steps, the order requires agencies to review privacy and civil rights protections before deploying drone technology and to adhere to a range of controls. Personally identifiable information collected in drone flights is to be kept no longer than 180 days, although there are exceptions.It's questionable whether such steps will satisfy civil liberties advocates, who've objected strongly to the government's vigorous use of digital surveillance in the name of national security. But drone advocates were generally happy with the proposal, although they disagreed with some of the details."I am very pleased to see a much more reasonable approach to future regulation than many feared," said Brendan Schulman, a New York attorney who unsuccessfully challenged FAA's restrictions on drone flights.The agency currently bans commercial drone flights except for a few dozen companies that have been granted waivers. That ban will stay in place until regulations become final, but FAA officials plan to continue granting waivers case by case. About 300 waiver requests are pending and new requests are being filed almost daily.The proposed rules are "a good first step" bringing the U.S. closer to realizing the benefits of drone technology, said Brian Wynne, president and CEO of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a trade group.An FAA analysis points to an estimate by the trade association that drones will create 70,000 jobs with an economic impact of more than $13.6 billion in the first three years after their integration into U.S. skies.In a big concession to industry, the FAA said it won't require an "airworthiness certificate" for small drones. The design and manufacture of each model of manned airplanes and helicopters go through a rigorous approval process by the FAA before they are granted airworthiness certificates. That can take years.The FAA decided that drone technology was changing so rapidly that by the time a model received an airworthiness certificate the remote-controlled aircraft might already be out of date, Huerta said.___

            LONDON   Twenty-something consumers raised on video games such asGrand Theft Autoand Angry Birds are being wooed by financial trading apps, keen to build bridges with a post-crisis generation that is uninterested in financial services or plain mistrustful.Bright colors, cartoon graphics and the ability to trade risk-free with virtual credits are features of apps such as BUX and Kapitall, which eschew financial lingo and complex charts in favor of competitive head-to-head battles and motivational messages like "OMG!" after placing a trade.While financial trading is a niche slice of the $15 billion mobile gaming industry, dominated by brands such as King Digital Entertainment's Candy Crush, some two-thirds of UK retail traders already use their smartphone or computer to buy or sell and app makers are sensing an opportunity."Developers are realizing that games are played by all kinds of people with different desires and motivations, and the same kind of person who is hooked on a computer video game may seek a similar thrill from the stock market," said Kam Star, founder and managing director at games development studio PlayGen.Nick Bortot, a former executive at online broker Binckbank, set up BUX (getbux.com) last year in Amsterdam and London. BUX's launch followed that of similar firms Kapitall and invstr (invstr.com).Both BUX and Kapitall offer players the chance to play games such as challenging each other on how stocks might perform, but they also offer players the opportunity to go from playing for points to betting actual money."I got hooked on BUX instantly, playing for fun, and trying to understand how shares and markets work. Since mid-December, I have been trading with real money," said Nathaniel Brooks, a 28 year old manager and Playstation aficionado.VIRTUAL POINTSAll three companies hope their bright graphics and games can lure a younger audience to the sometimes arcane world of finance, the least trusted industry in the world according to a 2014 survey by communications company Edelman. By contrast, technology is the most trusted.For now, invstr is only focusing on games that allow people to predict where markets may go for virtual points, and on building up a community of users, but the company may also let people bet real money at a later stage.Bortot said only 5 percent of BUX users converted from virtual play to real money, but there were still ways for BUX to make money from mere players.He said the company would charge small add-on fees of around 89 euro cents or roughly 80 pence to top up a "funBUX" virtual account, or to follow top traders on the Internet.For those converting from play money to real, BUX would then charge small commissions of around 35 pence or 40 euro cents per transaction, far cheaper than online brokerage costs at bigger, more mainstream firms.Some were skeptical over the prospects of such firms, while others expressed concerns over the possible trivialization of trading on financial markets."We are aware that the two markets are converging, but we are keeping our financial trading and gambling parts quite separate," said Shai Heffetz, managing director at InterTrader, which is owned by gambling company BWin.Party.Nevertheless, technology analyst Susan Anthony at brokerage Mirabaud Securities said the business could be worth exploring. "Whether or not these things become killer apps is hard to predict, but I can certainly see how they might become quite addictive for some."(This story corrects typographical error in first paragraph; also repeats to additional Reuters clients)(Editing by Lionel Laurent and David Holmes)

            BEAVER CREEK, Colo.  When the Alpine world ski championships came to the United States this month for the first time since 1999, the 13-day event was quickly defined by two competitive challenges taking place simultaneously.Could American ski racers back up their strong performance at the 2014 Sochi Olympics with another convincing showing, even with the worldwide ski community watching more closely than ever?And could a coalition of United States ski racing leaders show that the sport  aided by sophisticated broadcast technology  could capture a larger foothold in the crowded American sporting marketplace?With the world championships ending Sunday, the United States ski team, led by a mix of new and established stars, will leave Colorado with five medals, the second most of any country. Only the perennial ski power Austria, which won nine medals, will have more.International ski officials were impressed by the more than 200,000 fans who flocked to the resorts of Beaver Creek and Vail in the last two weeks, and encouraged by record television ratings for ski racing in the United States. They concluded their visit to the Rocky Mountains by talking about staging the championships in America more often. They may add more World Cup tour stops here, as well. Even a race in the Northeastern United States is being considered.With full stadiums and pioneering television coverage, we were thrilled with the championships, said Sarah Lewis, the secretary general of the International Ski Federation, ski racings ruling body, known as FIS. They certainly exceeded expectations and were a great step forward for ski racing in North America.With the American stars Ted Ligety and Mikaela Shiffrin each winning gold medals in dramatic fashion in the final days of the event, the United States ski team will go out on a high note, matching its medal total in Sochi.Ligety also won a bronze medalin the super combined, and on the first day of the competition, Lindsey Vonn won a bronze medal in the super-G. The most symbolic outcome for the American team might have been Travis Ganongs surprising second-place finish in the downhill. The breakout silver medal performance by Ganong, 26, came just two days after the longtime king of American ski racing, Bode Miller, 37,had a horrific crashthat may have ended his career.The Austrian mens team, led by the three-time defending World Cup overall champion Marcel Hirscher, appeared poised for a medal bonanza at the championships. But in the end, the Austrian men did the same as they did at the 2014 Winter Games, winning two races and finishing second in another.Among the women, the duel for overall supremacy between Tina Maze of Slovenia and Anna Fenninger of Austria continued to heat up. Fenninger, who showed her promise at last years Olympics, continued to impress in big races, winning the super-G and the giant slalom and finishing second in the downhill. Maze countered with three medals, including gold in the downhill and the super combined.Off the racecourse, a chief development at the championships involved innovative broadcasting methods, which might have attracted new American viewers and prospective young ski racers.In addition to more than 70 hours of live coverage on American television (ski racing in Europe is almost always shown on a tape delay in North America), the broadcast crew for this years world championships used as many as 200 camera positions to capture the racing over the two weeks. Broadcasters used five super-slow-motion cameras, which displayed images at a rate of 2,500 frames per second, about 100 times the standard rate used in television. A camera affixed to an overhead cable also followed racers down the racecourses for more than 800 yards.I never got to watch a world championships in this way growing up, Shiffrin said. I think a lot of kids sitting in living rooms across America will be inspired to try our sport. Its been so engaging  you can feel the speed, the terrain and the tactics. This kind of mainstream television exposure could be huge.Lewis said that the 2015 world championships would leave a legacy for broadcasting of ski racing and that the Vail/Beaver Creek organizing committee had set a new standard for the championships in a variety of ways. FIS is expected to discuss bringing the event back to Colorado in the future.Since many national teams travel to Colorado to train in November, Lewis said there would be discussions about adding another World Cup race or two early in the season. There are currently two World Cup stops in the United States: two womens races in Aspen, Colo., in late November and three mens races at Beaver Creek in early December.There are many U.S. ski resorts who would want to host a World Cup race, said Tiger Shaw, the chief executive of the United States Ski and Snowboard Association. And many that would do a great job.Shaw added that he thought there were several ski areas in the Northeastern United States that would be suitable sites for World Cup races. As early as the 1960s, World Cup Alpine races were held in New England and upstate New York, but it has been many years since one has been held in the Northeast.At the final competition of the championships on Sunday,the mens slalom, fans packed a four-story grandstand. Virtually every race drew capacity crowds, and in many cases, a few thousand fans hiked up the hill to get even closer to the action.Standing in the snow alongside the racecourse Sunday, one spectator held a sign above her head. It read: Thanks for the thrills! Come back soon.
